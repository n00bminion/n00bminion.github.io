Hi, I'm a developer 🖥️ based in London, working mainly with Python and SQL

I also recently returned back to university to study statistics 🧑‍🎓

This website is mainly about stuff I learned or I am learning currently, like how to create this website in Jekyll...


Feel free to have a look around the website or ping me via LinkedIn in the link below if you wanna chat or just connect 😊
