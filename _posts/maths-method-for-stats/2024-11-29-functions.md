This is another basic topic... Not much to say, mostly straight forward but links back to the knowledge from sets ðŸ§

### Functions

A function is $ f : A \rightarrow B $ is a rule which associate each $x$ member of set A which we call **domain** of $f$ (we also say $f$ is defined on A) to a **unique** $y$ value in the set B which we call **codomain** of $f$.

We then write 

$$ y = f(x) $$ 

Where we call $f(x)$ the value of $f$ at $x$. The set of values of $f$ as $x$ takes all the values in A is called the range of $f$. The range of the $f$ is a subset of the codomain of $f$.

For some functions, the input might not make sense and/or is not defined. $f(x)= \tfrac{1}{x}$ is one where $x=0$ is possible. We then say function is not defined at $x = 0$. Since the functions works for all real numbers, we can say that the "function $ f $ is defined by $ f(x) = \tfrac{1}{x}, x \ne 0$" or "function $$f : \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is defined by $f(x) = \tfrac{1}{x}$". 

Note that $$ \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} $$ denote real numbers excluding 0
