This is another basic topic... Not much to say, mostly straight forward but links back to the knowledge from sets ðŸ§

### Functions

A function is $ f : A \rightarrow B $ is a rule which associate each $x$ member of set A which we call **domain** of $f$ (we also say $f$ is defined on A) to a **unique** $y$ value in the set B which we call **codomain** of $f$.

We then write 

$$ y = f(x) $$ 

Where we call $f(x)$ the value of $f$ at $x$. The set of values of $f$ as $x$ takes all the values in A is called the range of $f$. The range of the $f$ is a subset of the codomain of $f$.

For some functions, the input might not make sense and/or is not defined. $f(x)= \tfrac{1}{x}$ is one where $x=0$ is possible. We then say function is not defined at $x = 0$. Since the functions works for all real numbers, we can say that the "function $ f $ is defined by $ f(x) = \tfrac{1}{x}, x \ne 0$" or "function $$f : \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$ is defined by $f(x) = \tfrac{1}{x}$". 

Note that $$ \mathbb{R}\backslash \{0\} $$ denote real numbers excluding 0

### Even & Odd Functions

$f$ is an **even** function if $f(x) = f(-x)$

$f$ is an **odd** function if $f(x) = -f(-x)$

Note that all even functions have a symmetry about the $y$-axis (reflected by the $y$-axis) whereas the odd functions will have a rotational symmetry of order 2. This effectively mean you just have to rotate it by 90 degrees twice to get back to the same graph.

An example of even function is $ f(x) = x^2 $. Both positive and negative $x$ maps to the same positive $y$ value. For the odd function, we can use $ f(x) = x $, where positive %x% maps to positive %y% only and vice versa. This satisfies the condition above $f(x) = -f(-x)$.

### Periodic Functions

$f$ is a **periodic** function if $f(x) = f(x+a)$ where $a$ is the period of $f$.

Usually periodic functions are some sort of trignometric functions.

### Polynomials Functions

The general polynomial of degree $n$ in $x$ can be written as

$$ y = f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + a_{n-2}x^{n-2} + ... +  a_1x^1 + a_0 \nonumber $$

where $a_n, a_{n-2}, a_{n-3} ... a_1, a $ are numbers or coefficients and $a_n \ne 0$. The degree of the polynomial is the highest power of $x$.

A popular polynomial function is the **quadratic** function.
