Starting off with the basics... It's been a while since I touched this stuff so it was a good refresher and I found it quite interesting. There are quite a few nuances to keep in mind along with the different notations. I find writing set notation using the properties of the elements quite challenging but I think it will come with practice ðŸ§

### Sets
Sets are collections of objects or elements.

The below denotes the elements $ a_1,a_2,a_3,...,a_n $ of set A. The 3 dots '...' between the commas stand for sequence of elements.
If not last object is specified, the sequence is assumed to be infinite

$$ A = \{ a_1,a_2,a_3 \dots a_n \} \nonumber$$

A common set is the set of intergers $\mathbb{Z}$ here we use the 3 dots on both sides to show infinity on both sides.

$$ \mathbb{Z} = \{ ...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3... \} \nonumber$$

If x is an element of the set A, this is written as $x \in A $ and is read as *"x belongs to A"*

We can also express the elements inside a set in terms of a property satisfied by those elements. For the elements of positive integers going into infinity, i.e. $$ \{ 1,2,3,... \} $$, this can be written as:

$$ \{x \in \mathbb{Z}: x > 0\} \nonumber$$

And this is read as *the set of integers x such that x > 0*. Thus the curly brackets can be translated to *the set of* and the colon is *such that*

If we need to exclude any elements,i,e, $ a_2, a_4 $, from the set A from above, this can be written as:

$$ A \setminus \{ a_2,a_4 \} \nonumber$$

And read as *A not $a_2$ or $a_4$*

### Standard Sets

$$\mathbb{N} = \{ 1,2,3\dots \} \nonumber$$

$$\mathbb{Z} = \{\dots,-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3,\dots\}\nonumber$$

$$\mathbb{Q} = set \ of \ rational \ numbers \nonumber$$

$$\mathbb{R} = set \ of \ real \ numbers \ (rational, \ irrational, \ postive \ integer \ and \ negative \ integer) \nonumber$$

$$\mathbb{C} = set \ of \ complex \ numbers \nonumber$$

<br>

### Subsets
B is subset of A if every element in B is also in A

We could also say B is contained in A or A contains B and is denoted as 

$$ B \subset A  \nonumber$$

The standard sets can be represented

$$ \mathbb{N} \subset \mathbb{Z} \subset \mathbb{Q} \subset \mathbb{R} \subset \mathbb{C} \nonumber$$

There is also a distinction between $$ B \subset A  \nonumber$$ and $$ B \subseteq  A  \nonumber$$. The former indicated a **proper** subset where the no. of elements in $B < A$. The latter is just a subset if the no. of elements in $B = A$.

In addition, if the sign is flipped such as $ B \supset A $ and $ B \supseteq A $, this indicates that B is a super set of A.

### Union & Intersection
If we have 2 sets A and B, the intersection of A and B is denoted $$ A \cap B $$ whilst the union is $$ A \cup B $$. The intersection is the set of elements which belongs to both A **and** B. The union is the set of elements in both A **or** B **or** both. 

It's necessary to have a universal set $ U $ which all the elements under consideration belong to. $ U $ is context dependent so it will need to be defined. In the case of set A and B, $ U $ will contain both A and B as well as any elements outside of A and B. 

If A and B do not have any common elements, it is said that they do not intersect and is written as 

$$ A \cap B = \emptyset \nonumber$$

$ \emptyset $ is a set where there are no elements or an **empty set**.

If set A and B are such that $ A \cap B = \emptyset \nonumber$ and $ A \cup B = U \nonumber$ (all the elements in the universal set is also in A and B), then we say A is the **complement** of B or vice versa, B is the complement of A. This is denoted as

$$ U \setminus A = B \nonumber$$ 

or 

$$ U \setminus B = A \nonumber$$ 

An example of this is the set of the positive natural numbers $$\mathbb{N}$$. If A is the set of all even positive numbers and B is the set of all the odd positive numbers, then

$$ U = \mathbb{N} \nonumber$$

$$ U \setminus A = B \nonumber$$ 

or vice versa like above

$$ A \cap B = \emptyset \nonumber$$

### Close & Open Intervals
When we don't need all the values in a set up to infinity, we can use open and close intervals to show this set

For the close interval, $[a,b]$, is the set of values x which satisfies the inequalities $ a \le x \le b $

For the open interval, $(a,b)$, is the set of values x which satisfies the inequalities $ a < x < b $

Note that
* The notation is slightly different for open and close interval, ( ) vs [ ]
* Close interval is inclusive of a & b whilst open does not include a & b
* We can mix and match the two brackets i.e. (-1,3] would be $ -1 < x \le 3 $
* Infinity can also be written using open interval $( -\infty,\infty )$ for $ \infty < x < \infty $ or $[0,\infty)$ for $ 0 \le x < \infty $
