<!-- ### Venn Diagrams

Given a sample space ${\mathbb{S}}$ and 2 events A and B, the interactions between the 2 events are:

<br>

$A \cup B $ where the shaded region is A, B or both

<br>


$A \cap B $ where the shaded region is only both A and B 

![Image](/assets/images/set_intersect.png){:height="50%" width="50%"}

<br>

$ A \cap B = \emptyset \nonumber$ where the two events A and B do not intersect and are mutually exclusive. This also results in the empty set $\emptyset$ where there are no elements in the set

<br>

$ \overline A $ is the complement of A where it showfs A not occurring i.e. everything not A

<br>

$ A/B $ or $ A \cap \overline B $ where all things in A but nothing in B. This is the set difference between A and B
